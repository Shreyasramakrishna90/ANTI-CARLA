# Scene Generator

The scene generator is the core of the framework. It uses a Scenario Description Language to describe a scene in CARLA simulation. It is then integrated with a set of specification files that has the test parameters selected by the users. The language and the specification file are connected to samplers to generate different scenes in the simulator.
